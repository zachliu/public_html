In this assignment, I submitted the following three files:

    README
    cs536_hw5.cpp(contains main())
    Makefile

Language used:	C++
OS used:	Windows 7
Compiler used:	g++ in tux (ssh to tux server: tux.cs.drexel.edu)
		Version 4.3.3 (Ubuntu 4.3.3-5ubuntu4)
Compile/link:	Makefile has the default rule compile my program

Libraries included:
# iostream
# fstream
# cstring
# ctype
# cstdlib
# cmath

Features of the program:
* It handles command-line options with any arbitrary order and any subset of the options.
* It recognizes the mistakes in the input options such as illegal file name, unexpected 
  characters, and so on.
  eg.
	if the input command is: 
		./cs536_hw5 -1 -r 30s -s 1.2 > out.xpm
	error message will be:
		Option '-1' missing arguments! Use default value: hw5.smf
		Argument follows '-r' should be a integer number! '30s' is NOT a number!
 	
	if the input command is:
		./cs536_hw5 -1 -r 30 -r 34 -s 1.2 > out.xpm
	error message will be:
		Option '-1' missing arguments! Use default value: hw5.smf
		Too many '-r'! Only the 1st one will be accepted!

* It reads arbitrary number of  vertices and faces of a 3D model from a SMF file.
* It uses Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm for polygon (triangle) clipping.
* It uses scan-line algorithm for polygon (triangle) filling.
* It implements Z-buffer rendering with 20 shades for each color (R/G/B).
* It outputs final results to an xpm file.
