In this assignment, I submitted the following three files:

    README
    cs536_hw2.cpp (contains main())
    Makefile

Language used:	C++
OS used:	Windows Vista & Windows 7
Compiler used:	g++ in tux (ssh to tux server: tux.cs.drexel.edu)
		Version 4.3.3 (Ubuntu 4.3.3-5ubuntu4)
Compile/link:	Makefile has the default rule compile my program

Libraries included:
# iostream
# fstream
# cstring
# cctype
# cstdlib
# cmath

Features of the program:
* It handles command-line options with any arbitrary order and any subset of the options.
* It recognizes the mistakes in the input options such as illegal file name, unexpected 
  characters, and so on.
* It read in a polygon from a file, applies 2D transformations to it, 
  clips it against the world window using the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm.
* A linked list data structure has been used in this homework. The polygon from 
  a ps file can have arbitrary number of vertices.
* It uses Bresenham algorithm for line drawing.
* It outputs final results to an xpm file.
